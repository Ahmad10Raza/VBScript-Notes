    "### **Error Handling in VBScript**\n",
    "\n",
    "Error handling is an essential part of writing robust and reliable scripts. In VBScript, errors can occur during script execution, and you need a way to handle them gracefully. This prevents your script from crashing and helps you diagnose problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Types of Errors in VBScript**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three primary types of errors in VBScript:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Syntax Errors**  \n",
    "2. **Runtime Errors**  \n",
    "3. **Logical Errors**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these errors behaves differently and requires different approaches to handle them effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Syntax Errors**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: A **syntax error** occurs when the script doesn't conform to the rules of VBScript's language syntax. This type of error prevents the script from running at all because the interpreter can't understand the code.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Example of a Syntax Error**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```vbscript\n",
    "' Missing closing parenthesis\n",
    "MsgBox \"Hello, world!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation**: The above code is missing the closing double quotation mark (`\"`) for the string, which causes a syntax error. The script won't run at all due to this error.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How to Handle**: Syntax errors are usually detected by the VBScript engine before the script is executed, and you will see a compilation error message in the editor or the script host. These errors need to be corrected for the script to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Runtime Errors**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: A **runtime error** occurs when the script is executed, but an unexpected condition happens during execution, such as dividing by zero or attempting to access a non-existent file. These errors stop the execution of the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example of a Runtime Error**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```vbscript\n",
    "' Division by zero causes runtime error\n",
    "Dim x, y\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "y = 0\n",
    "MsgBox x / y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation**: The script attempts to divide `x` by `y`, but since `y = 0`, this will cause a runtime error because division by zero is not allowed in VBScript.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How to Handle**: You can handle runtime errors using `On Error Resume Next` or `On Error GoTo` for more control.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Logical Errors**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Definition**: A **logical error** occurs when the script runs without errors, but it doesn't produce the correct result. These errors are the hardest to detect because the script doesn't crash, but the output is incorrect or unintended.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example of a Logical Error**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```vbscript\n",
    "' Incorrect logic causes wrong result\n",
    "Dim a, b\n",
    "a = 10\n",
    "b = 20\n",
    "MsgBox a - b ' Expected sum, but the script shows the difference\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation**: The intention might be to add `a` and `b`, but instead, the code subtracts them (`a - b`). Since the script runs without an error, it's a logical error because the result is not as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How to Handle**: Logical errors can only be resolved by carefully reviewing the code, understanding the logic, and making necessary corrections.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Error Handling Techniques in VBScript**\n",
    "\n",
    "In VBScript, you can handle errors in different ways. There are two main methods for error handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. `On Error Resume Next`**\n",
    "This statement tells VBScript to ignore runtime errors and continue executing the script. If an error occurs, the script will proceed to the next line of code without stopping.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```vbscript\n",
    "On Error Resume Next\n",
    "' Code that may cause an error\n",
    "Dim x, y\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "y = 0\n",
    "MsgBox x / y\n",
    "\n",
    "' Check for errors\n",
    "If Err.Number <> 0 Then\n",
    "    MsgBox \"Error occurred: \" & Err.Description\n",
    "End If\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation**:\n",
    "  - The `On Error Resume Next` statement allows the script to continue running even after a runtime error occurs.\n",
    "  - The `Err.Number` and `Err.Description` properties are used to detect and handle the error. If an error occurs, the script displays a message with the error description.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. `On Error GoTo`**\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement allows you to redirect the flow of control to a specific label in your script when an error occurs. This provides more control over error handling compared to `On Error Resume Next`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```vbscript\n",
    "On Error GoTo ErrorHandler\n",
    "\n",
    "' Code that may cause an error\n",
    "Dim x, y\n",
    "x = 10\n",
    "y = 0\n",
    "MsgBox x / y\n",
    "\n",
    "Exit Sub ' Skip error handler if no error occurs\n",
    "\n",
    "ErrorHandler:\n",
    "MsgBox \"Error occurred: \" & Err.Description\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation**:\n",
    "  - When an error occurs, control is passed to the `ErrorHandler` label.\n",
    "  - The script displays the error message using `Err.Description` and gracefully handles the error.\n",
    "  - The `Exit Sub` ensures that the `ErrorHandler` is only called if an error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Error Object (`Err`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "VBScript provides the `Err` object to handle errors. It contains properties and methods that allow you to manage errors effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Common Properties of the `Err` Object**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`Err.Number`**: Returns the error number (if an error occurs).\n",
    "2. **`Err.Description`**: Provides a description of the error.\n",
    "3. **`Err.Source`**: The source of the error (usually the name of the script or function).\n",
    "4. **`Err.Clear`**: Resets the `Err` object, clearing any error that might have occurred.\n",
    "5. **`Err.HelpContext`**: Returns the help context ID for the error (if available).\n",
    "6. **`Err.HelpFile`**: The file that contains the help information for the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example of Using the `Err` Object**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```vbscript\n",
    "On Error Resume Next\n",
    "Dim result\n",
    "result = 10 / 0\n",
    "\n",
    "If Err.Number <> 0 Then\n",
    "    MsgBox \"Error \" & Err.Number & \": \" & Err.Description\n",
    "    Err.Clear ' Clear the error\n",
    "End If\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation**: This code attempts division by zero. If an error occurs, it displays the error number and description and clears the error using `Err.Clear`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Syntax Errors**: Errors in the code structure that prevent the script from running. These are usually caught before execution.\n",
    "- **Runtime Errors**: Errors that occur during the execution of the script. They can be handled using `On Error Resume Next` or `On Error GoTo`.\n",
    "- **Logical Errors**: Errors where the script runs but doesn't produce the expected output. These require code review and logic corrections.\n",
    "- **Error Handling in VBScript**: You can handle errors using `On Error Resume Next` for ignoring errors or `On Error GoTo` for custom error handling. The `Err` object provides properties to retrieve error details.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using these error-handling techniques, you can create more resilient and predictable VBScript programs.\n"

    "   - **Example**: `Err.Description = \"Permission Denied\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`Err.Source`**:\n",
    "   - Contains the name of the **script or function** that generated the error.\n",
    "   - Useful for tracing where the error occurred in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`Err.HelpFile`**:\n",
    "   - If available, provides the **path to a help file** that may contain additional information about the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`Err.HelpContext`**:\n",
    "   - If available, provides the **help context ID** for the error. This can be used in combination with `Err.HelpFile` to provide detailed help.\n",

    "### **Debugging in VBScript**\n",
    "\n",
    "Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors or issues in your code. Although VBScript does not have advanced debugging tools like other programming languages, there are still several techniques you can use to help debug your scripts effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Common Debugging Techniques in VBScript:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using `MsgBox` for Debugging**:\n",
    "   - **MsgBox** is a simple way to display variable values or checkpoints in your code to understand whatâ€™s happening.\n",
    "   - It can be used to track the flow of your script and check the state of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```vbscript\n",
    "   Dim x, y\n",
    "   x = 5\n",
    "   y = 10\n",
    "   MsgBox \"Before addition: x = \" & x & \", y = \" & y\n",
    "   MsgBox \"Sum: \" & (x + y)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using `WScript.Echo` for Debugging** (in Windows Script Host environment):\n",
    "   - `WScript.Echo` prints information to the command line or console window when running the script from a `.vbs` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```vbscript\n",
    "   WScript.Echo \"Starting Script\"\n",
    "   Dim result\n",
    "   result = 10 / 0 ' Intentional error for demonstration\n",
    "   WScript.Echo \"Result: \" & result\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Using `On Error Resume Next` for Ignoring Errors Temporarily**:\n",
    "   - While debugging, you can temporarily ignore errors using `On Error Resume Next` and handle errors later. This lets the script continue running and provides control to inspect values.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```vbscript\n",
    "   On Error Resume Next\n",
    "   Dim x\n",
    "   x = 10 / 0 ' Causes an error, but script will continue\n",
    "   If Err.Number <> 0 Then\n",
    "       MsgBox \"An error occurred: \" & Err.Description\n",
    "   End If\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Setting Breakpoints (in an IDE or VBScript Editor)**:\n",
    "   - If you're using an integrated script editor like **PrimalScript** or **Microsoft Script Debugger**, you can set breakpoints to pause execution at a certain line and step through the code. Unfortunately, VBScript doesnâ€™t support breakpoints directly in its native environment (e.g., Notepad).\n",
    "   \n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   - Use a VBScript editor that allows you to set breakpoints and step through the code line-by-line.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Print Statements in Code**:\n",
    "   - Sometimes, the simplest debugging method is to insert `MsgBox` or `WScript.Echo` statements at various points to check the state of variables or flow of control.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example**:\n",
    "   ```vbscript\n",
    "   Dim counter\n",
    "   counter = 1\n",
    "   MsgBox \"Counter: \" & counter\n",
    "   counter = counter + 1\n",
    "   MsgBox \"After incrementing: \" & counter\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Use of `Err.Clear`**:\n",
    "   - Always remember to use `Err.Clear` after handling an error to reset the error state and ensure that youâ€™re not checking an old error after fixing one.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary of `Err` Object and Debugging in VBScript:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Err` Object**:\n",
    "  - Provides essential information about runtime errors, such as error number (`Err.Number`), description (`Err.Description`), and the source of the error (`Err.Source`).\n",
    "  - Useful properties for handling and diagnosing errors in the script.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Debugging**:\n",
    "  - Techniques like using `MsgBox`, `WScript.Echo`, and inserting print statements can help you debug your code.\n",
    "  - `On Error Resume Next` allows you to ignore errors temporarily, while `Err.Clear` resets the error state.\n",
    "  - In more advanced editors, breakpoints and stepping through code can assist with debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying these debugging techniques and utilizing the `Err` object for error handling, you can develop more reliable and stable VBScript code.\n"
