    "### **Control Structures in VBScript**\n",
    "\n",
    "Control structures allow you to control the flow of execution in your program based on certain conditions. In VBScript, the primary control structures for conditional statements are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If...Then**\n",
    "- **If...Then...Else**\n",
    "- **Select Case**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. `If...Then`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest form of conditional statement in VBScript. It evaluates an expression and executes a block of code if the condition is `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```vbscript\n",
    "If condition Then\n",
    "    ' Code to execute if the condition is True\n",
    "End If\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```vbscript\n",
    "Dim age\n",
    "age = 18\n",
    "\n",
    "If age >= 18 Then\n",
    "    MsgBox \"You are an adult\"\n",
    "End If\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation**: In this example, the `If` statement checks if `age` is greater than or equal to 18. Since `age = 18`, the condition is `True`, and the message `\"You are an adult\"` will be displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. `If...Then...Else`**\n",
    "\n",
    "This conditional statement is used when you want to execute one block of code if the condition is `True` and another block if the condition is `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```vbscript\n",
    "If condition Then\n",
    "    ' Code to execute if the condition is True\n",
    "Else\n",
    "    ' Code to execute if the condition is False\n",
    "End If\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```vbscript\n",
    "Dim age\n",
    "age = 15\n",
    "\n",
    "If age >= 18 Then\n",
    "    MsgBox \"You are an adult\"\n",
    "Else\n",
    "    MsgBox \"You are a minor\"\n",
    "End If\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation**: In this example, the `If` statement checks if `age` is greater than or equal to 18. Since `age = 15`, the condition is `False`, so the message `\"You are a minor\"` will be displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. `If...Then...ElseIf...Else`**\n",
    "\n",
    "This variation allows you to check multiple conditions. You can add multiple `ElseIf` clauses to test different conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```vbscript\n",
    "If condition1 Then\n",
    "    ' Code to execute if condition1 is True\n",
    "ElseIf condition2 Then\n",
    "    ' Code to execute if condition2 is True\n",
    "Else\n",
    "    ' Code to execute if all conditions are False\n",
    "End If\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```vbscript\n",
    "Dim age\n",
    "age = 25\n",
    "\n",
    "If age >= 18 Then\n",
    "    MsgBox \"You are an adult\"\n",
    "ElseIf age >= 13 Then\n",
    "    MsgBox \"You are a teenager\"\n",
    "Else\n",
    "    MsgBox \"You are a child\"\n",
    "End If\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation**: The program checks three conditions:\n",
    "  - If `age >= 18`, it shows `\"You are an adult\"`.\n",
    "  - If `age >= 13` but less than 18, it shows `\"You are a teenager\"`.\n",
    "  - Otherwise, it shows `\"You are a child\"`.\n",
    "  - Since `age = 25`, the message `\"You are an adult\"` will be displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. `Select Case`**\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Select Case` statement is used when you have multiple conditions to check against a single expression. It is a cleaner alternative to multiple `If...Then...ElseIf` statements, especially when the conditions are based on the same variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```vbscript\n",
    "Select Case expression\n",
    "    Case value1\n",
    "        ' Code to execute if expression equals value1\n",
    "    Case value2\n",
    "        ' Code to execute if expression equals value2\n",
    "    Case Else\n",
    "        ' Code to execute if no case matches\n",
    "End Select\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```vbscript\n",
    "Dim day\n",
    "day = 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Select Case day\n",
    "    Case 1\n",
    "        MsgBox \"Monday\"\n",
    "    Case 2\n",
    "        MsgBox \"Tuesday\"\n",
    "    Case 3\n",
    "        MsgBox \"Wednesday\"\n",
    "    Case 4\n",
    "        MsgBox \"Thursday\"\n",
    "    Case 5\n",
    "        MsgBox \"Friday\"\n",
    "    Case 6\n",
    "        MsgBox \"Saturday\"\n",
    "    Case 7\n",
    "        MsgBox \"Sunday\"\n",
    "    Case Else\n",
    "        MsgBox \"Invalid day\"\n",
    "End Select\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation**: The `Select Case` evaluates the variable `day` and checks which value matches. Since `day = 3`, it matches the `Case 3` block, and the message `\"Wednesday\"` will be displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Multiple Conditions in `Select Case`**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use ranges or multiple values for each case.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```vbscript\n",
    "Dim score\n",
    "score = 85\n",
    "\n",
    "Select Case score\n",
    "    Case 90 To 100\n",
    "        MsgBox \"Excellent\"\n",
    "    Case 75 To 89\n",
    "        MsgBox \"Good\"\n",
    "    Case 50 To 74\n",
    "        MsgBox \"Pass\"\n",
    "    Case Else\n",
    "        MsgBox \"Fail\"\n",
    "End Select\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explanation**: The `Select Case` checks the value of `score`:\n",
    "  - If it's between 90 and 100, it shows `\"Excellent\"`.\n",
    "  - If it's between 75 and 89, it shows `\"Good\"`.\n",
    "  - If it's between 50 and 74, it shows `\"Pass\"`.\n",
    "  - Otherwise, it shows `\"Fail\"`.\n",
    "  - Since `score = 85`, it falls into the `\"Good\"` range, so that message is displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Summary of Conditional Statements**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`If...Then`**: Checks a condition and executes code if the condition is `True`.\n",
    "- **`If...Then...Else`**: Checks a condition, executes one block of code if `True`, and another if `False`.\n",
    "- **`If...Then...ElseIf...Else`**: Allows for checking multiple conditions.\n",
    "- **`Select Case`**: A more efficient way to check multiple possible values for a single expression.\n",
