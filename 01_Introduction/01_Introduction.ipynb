    "### **History and Evolution of VBScript**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Origin and Release:**\n",
    "   - VBScript was developed by Microsoft and first released in **1996** as part of Internet Explorer 3.0.\n",
    "   - It is a subset of Visual Basic and was designed to provide scripting capabilities for web developers and system administrators.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Integration with Windows:**\n",
    "   - Initially, VBScript was popular for client-side scripting in web browsers, but its use in web development declined with the rise of JavaScript.\n",
    "   - It found a significant role in automating tasks within Windows, using **Windows Script Host (WSH)** and Active Server Pages (ASP).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Key Versions:**\n",
    "   - VBScript 2.0 (1997): Introduced enhanced support for COM (Component Object Model).\n",
    "   - VBScript 5.0 (1999): Added new features such as Regular Expressions, Classes, and improved error handling.\n",
    "   - VBScript 5.6 (2000): Became the most commonly used version, included advanced features for Windows automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Deprecation:**\n",
    "   - Microsoft announced the deprecation of VBScript in 2019, removing its support in Internet Explorer 11.\n",
    "   - Although deprecated for web scripting, VBScript remains useful for Windows automation and legacy systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Installation and Setup on Windows**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Prerequisites:**\n",
    "   - VBScript is pre-installed on most Windows operating systems as part of the Windows Script Host (WSH).\n",
    "   - No separate installation is needed for VBScript to run basic scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Verifying VBScript Availability:**\n",
    "   - Open a command prompt and type:\n",
    "     ```cmd\n",
    "     cscript //?\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     If VBScript is available, it will display the Windows Script Host usage instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Creating and Running a VBScript File:**\n",
    "   - Use any text editor like Notepad to write your script.\n",
    "   - Save the file with a `.vbs` extension, e.g., `script.vbs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Executing VBScript:**\n",
    "   - Double-click the `.vbs` file to execute it. The script will run in Windows Script Host.\n",
    "   - Alternatively, run the script from the command prompt:\n",
    "     ```cmd\n",
    "     cscript script.vbs\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     or\n",
    "     ```cmd\n",
    "     wscript script.vbs\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Optional Tools for Better Scripting:**\n",
    "   - **Microsoft Script Debugger**: Helps debug VBScript code.\n",
    "   - **Third-party Editors**: Use editors like Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code for syntax highlighting and easier script management.\n"

    "### **Running VBScript: Using Windows Script Host (WSH)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Windows Script Host (WSH)** is the engine that executes VBScript and JScript files on Windows. It allows scripts to interact with the operating system, automate tasks, and create powerful utilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Steps to Run VBScript Using WSH**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Create a VBScript File**\n",
    "1. Open a text editor like **Notepad**.\n",
    "2. Write your VBScript code. For example:\n",
    "   ```vbscript\n",
    "   MsgBox \"Hello, World!\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "3. Save the file with a `.vbs` extension, such as `example.vbs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Execute the VBScript File**\n",
    "\n",

    "- Double-click the `.vbs` file.\n",
    "- The script runs in GUI mode, and you see a message box (in this example).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Using `cscript` (Command Line)**\n",
    "1. Open a Command Prompt.\n",
    "2. Navigate to the directory where the `.vbs` file is saved.\n",
    "3. Run the script using the following command:\n",
    "   ```cmd\n",
    "   cscript example.vbs\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "4. The script runs in console mode, displaying output in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **3. Choosing Between `wscript` and `cscript`**\n",
    "- **`wscript`**: Runs scripts with graphical output (message boxes, pop-ups).\n",
    "- **`cscript`**: Executes scripts in the command line, suitable for text-based output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```vbscript\n",
    "' Example script with both GUI and text output\n",
    "If WScript.FullName Like \"*wscript.exe\" Then\n",
    "    MsgBox \"Running in GUI mode!\"\n",
    "Else\n",
    "    WScript.Echo \"Running in Command Prompt!\"\n",
    "End If\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **WSH Features**\n",
    "1. **Script Execution Modes**:\n",
    "   - **Silent Mode**: Suppress pop-ups by redirecting output to files or disabling message boxes.\n",
    "   - **Interactive Mode**: Show dialogs and message boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interacting with the Operating System**:\n",
    "   - Perform file operations.\n",
    "   - Access system properties.\n",
    "   - Automate repetitive tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Running Multiple Scripts**:\n",
    "   - Use a `.bat` file to run multiple VBScript files sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Testing Example: Simple Script**\n",
